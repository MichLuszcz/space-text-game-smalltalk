- use the statue to break the window (alien, statue and window disappear, make path to pods)
- use the hammer on the window with no effect but a message DONE
- use the saw on the table (get wooden table leg, destroy table, break saw) DONE
- use the wood on the fire (get burning wood)  DONE
- use the burning wood on the alien mass (both disappear, creates path to escape pods) DONE
- use electrical tools on broken console
